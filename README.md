This resipotary aims to present our result to solve the problem of the project of topological data analysis in CSC_42021_EP - Conception et analyse d'algorithmes (2024-2025) of the École Polytechnique. We present an alogrithm to compute the simplexes and the filtration value of a given $\alpha$-complex or Čech-complex of a arbitary point-set. We devolepped an alogrithm general enough to calculate the circumcircle of $n$ points in $d$-dimension euclidean space.
